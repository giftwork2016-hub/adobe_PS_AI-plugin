# Adobe Photoshop AI Plugin Concepts

This repository contains conceptual design work and a runnable prototype panel for integrating advanced generative or editing AI services into Adobe Photoshop 24.4 via UXP plugins. See [`docs/ai_plugin_design.md`](docs/ai_plugin_design.md) for the full architecture proposal and feature breakdown.

## Repository Contents
- `docs/ai_plugin_design.md` – comprehensive design for a hybrid cloud/on-device AI assistant plugin.
- `uxp-plugin/` – unpackaged Photoshop UXP panel that demonstrates AI workflow orchestration, Photoshop API calls, and Spectrum Web Components styling.

## Load the UXP Plugin Prototype
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. In Photoshop 24.4 (or newer), open **Plugins → Development → Load UXP Plugin…**
3. Select the `uxp-plugin` directory. Photoshop will load the unpacked plugin immediately and open the **AI Co-Creation** panel.

### What the panel demonstrates
- Spectrum Web Components UI for configuring prompts, selecting AI backends (Qwen, Google Nano Banana, xAI Grok, Meta AI), and toggling workflow options.
- Live document introspection through the Photoshop `app` module and `action.batchPlay`, surfaced as status text within the panel.
- Placeholder AI preview generation rendered as SVG inside the panel for rapid iteration before wiring a real model endpoint.
- A safe placeholder `core.executeAsModal` action that inserts a new layer in the active document, illustrating how to hand off AI output to Photoshop.

### Connecting a real AI service
- Replace the `simulatePreview` function in [`uxp-plugin/main.js`](uxp-plugin/main.js) with calls to your AI service endpoint (e.g., Qwen, Grok, Google "Nano Banana," or Meta AI).
- Swap the placeholder layer creation logic with pixel import or smart object replacement once you have actual image bytes.
- Extend [`uxp-plugin/manifest.json`](uxp-plugin/manifest.json) with additional commands or menu entries as needed.
