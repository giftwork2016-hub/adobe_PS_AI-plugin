# Adobe Photoshop AI Plugin Concepts

This repository contains conceptual design work for integrating advanced generative or editing AI services into Adobe Photoshop 24.4 via UXP plugins. See [`docs/ai_plugin_design.md`](docs/ai_plugin_design.md) for a detailed architecture proposal and feature breakdown.

## Repository Contents
- `docs/ai_plugin_design.md` â€“ comprehensive design for a hybrid cloud/on-device AI assistant plugin.

## Getting Started
While this repo does not include production-ready code, the design document outlines:
- Recommended development environment setup.
- Plugin scaffolding and configuration files.
- Backend service interactions and security considerations.

Use the plan as a reference for building a real plugin that connects Photoshop with AI models such as Qwen, Google "Nano Banana," xAI Grok, or Meta AI services.
